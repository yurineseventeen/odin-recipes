        <h1>Odin Recipes</h1>
        <p>A collection of recipes I actually make that don't take too much of my time. All of them can be cooked in under 30 minutes, including preparation (I guess...)</p>
        <p>I don't put exact amount in the ingredients because I use my feeling</p>
        <p>Steps may or may not be clear to you.</p>
